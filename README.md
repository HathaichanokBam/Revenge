# Revenge
A java game using parallex scrolling, sprites, basic save game, and ps3 controller.

######To use A PS3 controller you need to install the [jinput api](http://yaolddawg.blogspot.com/2011/08/configure-open-source-controller-jinput.html)
######This has not been tested on other remotes, nor will I, it will give errors if remotes doesn't exist (name is wrong) if you try to use it.
######It is disable for now


Will update this later when i have time to give a better description
